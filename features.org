* importmagic.el

This is an elisp package intended to use [[https://github.com/alecthomas/importmagic][importmagic]] to autoimport
missing symbols in Python without having to bother to go to the
beginning of the file to manually add the imports. I've tried it with
Elpy and it works ok.

This file is intended to *help the developing process*.

** [0/5] Work process

   - [ ] Write a python module that returns candidates
   - [ ] Write an elisp extension that uses Python to get candidates
   - [ ] Write more elisp to choose from the list. Maybe ivy, maybe
     Helm
   - [ ] Write elisp to actually insert the selected candidate
   - [ ] Test it and bind it to a key.
   - [ ] Maybe submit it to MELPA.
